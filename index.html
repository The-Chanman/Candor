After Hamas's electoral victory in 2006, the Quartet conditioned future foreign assistance to the Palestinian National Authority (PA) on the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the State of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements.</li>
								          <li class="list-group-item">Hamas rejected these demands,[19] which resulted in the Quartet's suspension of its foreign assistance program, and the imposition of economic sanctions by the Israelis. A year later, following Hamas's seizure of power in the Gaza Strip in June 2007, the territory officially recognized as the PA was split between Fatah in the West Bank, and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</li>
								          <li class="list-group-item">The division of governance between the parties had effectively resulted in the collapse of bipartisan governance of the PA. However, in 2014, a Palestinian Unity Government, composed of both Fatah and Hamas, was formed. The latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 and was suspended in 2014.</li>

					                <br>
									<p>If you’ve never been to the Mission than you cannot begin to understand the attachment the people who live here have to it.  Let me clarify.  Visiting doesn’t count.  Spending a season here doesn’t count.  People come for the Mexican food, the beautiful Dolores park, the views...and I love all that.  But you can’t understand the Mission until you understand and connect with the people.  Play soccer against the 30+ men soccer “team” or go to a slam poetry event, that’s how you see the Mission.</p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/tortillas.jpg" alt="" > <br>
									<b>Mission & Our Soul</b>
									<p>
									I keep hearing seeing my friends being evicted.  That word gets thrown around a lot so let me try to make you feel it.  
									<br>
									Imagine you’re vacationing abroad, waiting in the lobby of a hotel for a room you know you booked a while ago.  You’re getting frustrated.  Your family is there.  You sleep in the lobby overnight waiting for this guaranteed room.  The owners finally come out and tell you your room is no longer available.  Someone else paid more.  You’re kicked out on to the street.  Now imagine you can’t just book another place, you can’t just fly back to your home.  Your family has nowhere.
									<br>
									Now if that doesn’t help you see our situation, come down the The Mission and I’ll personally give you a tour. </p>

					                <br>
					                <p>Space & Integration<br>
									People are coming into the Mission and saying they are part of the community but don’t show it.  We have a community soccer field in the neighborhood that has always been open for everyone.  Permits didn’t exist.  A bunch of new tech workers were playing a game and would rather have played alone on their side of the field than join us.  We played two separate games on one field.  It still feels segregated at times.</p>
									<p>Culture & Trends<br>
									I was walking around the other day and saw the Mission District Tour.  We didn’t have those when I was a kid.  We weren’t treated as a spectacle and abnormality for the world. 
									<br>
									Across the street from my first home was a Latino bakery called Mi Rancho.  Everyone in the neighborhood came here but it has since been replaced by a hip salon.  </p>
									<p>Home & Eviction <br>
									I just remember being in my house and having to stay in my room while people were going through closets and rooms and checking everything out.  That’s when we were evicted. 
									<br>
									I’m not a unique story.  This is happening weekly. </p>
